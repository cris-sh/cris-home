# AlquiPC - Billing System

## Project Overview

AlquiPC is a modern billing system specifically designed for computer equipment rental. Developed following ISO/IEC 25010 quality standards, the system calculates rental prices considering various variables such as location, duration, and number of devices, offering a comprehensive solution for businesses in the technology rental sector.

## Main Features

- **Automatic ID generation for clients**: Each order receives a unique identifier
- **Dynamic price calculation** based on multiple factors:
  - Number of devices (minimum 2)
  - Initial rental days
  - Additional days (with 2% discount)
  - Location (within the city, outside with a 5% surcharge, or on-premise with a 5% discount)
- **Digital billing** with detailed summary
- **PDF export** of invoices
- **Email sending simulation**
- **Dark/light mode** to improve user experience
- **Responsive design** adaptable to mobile and desktop devices

## Technologies Used

The project uses a modern technology stack focused on performance and development experience:

- **TypeScript**: For static typing and more robust code
- **Vite**: As a fast build tool and development server
- **TailwindCSS**: CSS framework for efficient and consistent design
- **jsPDF + html2canvas-pro**: For PDF document generation
- **Bun**: Ultra-fast testing environment and package manager

## Implementation and Architecture

The system is structured following principles of modular design and maintainability:

```
src/
├── models/      # Type definitions and interfaces
├── services/    # Services for calculations and API
├── main.ts      # Application entry point
└── style.css    # Global styles
```

Price calculations implement specific business logic that covers different rental scenarios, applying discounts or surcharges according to the specific conditions of each order.

## Use Cases

The billing system handles various rental scenarios:

1. **Rental within the city**: No additional charges
2. **Rental outside the city**: 5% surcharge
3. **On-premise rental**: 5% discount
4. **Additional days**: 2% discount for each extra day

## Learnings and Challenges

During the development of AlquiPC, I faced specific challenges such as:

- **Precision in financial calculations**: Implementing algorithms that correctly handle decimal calculations in JavaScript
- **PDF integration**: Converting dynamic HTML components to PDF documents while maintaining visual fidelity
- **Smooth user experience**: Balancing data validation and instant feedback to create an intuitive user experience

## Testing and Quality

The project includes unit tests to verify the correct functionality of price calculations, ensuring that the results are accurate in all possible scenarios.

## Conclusion

AlquiPC represents a scalable and modern solution for computer equipment rental companies, combining ease of use with advanced billing and order management functionalities.
